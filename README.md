# AsyncLazy

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/peterekepeter/async-lazy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/peterekepeter/async-lazy)

This is a support library for asynchrounus and lazy execution for your code.
I found that I was in need of these classes multiple times, so I've decided to put them in an open source nuget.
