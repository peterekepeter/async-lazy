# AsyncLazy

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/peterekepeter/async-lazy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/peterekepeter/async-lazy)

This is a support library for asynchrounus and lazy execution for your code.
I found that I was in need of these classes multiple times, so I've decided to put them in an open source nuget.

Check out the unit tests to see some examples of what can be done.
